	- main.py (same for any topology, which is to be given as argument in config.yaml) * -> still not convinced about this... maybe a directory pyggrid/runs? pyggrid/examples?
	- config.yaml
	- read.me
	- environment.yaml
	- project_structure.yaml
	
NOTE: src/siting/ maybe to be removed and migrated into a standalone resite/ project.
	  src/sizing/ would disappear, while main.py and config.yaml are moved to py_ggrid/ root.
	  data/vres_profiles/transfer_functions to be moved under data/technologies/

	  src/data/land_data/ would disappear
